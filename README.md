# 3D-Solar-System

This project is a web-based 3D Solar System simulation built using Three.js. It visualizes the sun and 8 major planets in orbit, with interactive camera and control panels for adjusting camera angles, zoom, and planet orbit speeds.
🚀 Features
•	🪐 Animated orbits of Mercury through Neptune around the Sun
•	🎥 Camera controls: Distance, angle, and elevation sliders
•	🖱️ Mouse drag & scroll: Rotate and zoom the camera
•	🧭 Keyboard navigation: Arrow keys to adjust camera view
•	🖱️ Click-to-focus: Click a planet to center the camera on it
•	⏸️ Pause/Resume animation
•	🌗 Toggle between Light/Dark themes
•	🛠️ Customizable planet speeds via sliders
•	⭐ Starfield background for space realism
•	📝 Tooltips on hover to show planet names

🖥️ How to Run
1.	Save the provided code as index.html.
2.	Open it in any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
3.	Interact using:
o	Sliders on the right to control camera and speeds
o	Mouse drag for rotating view
o	Mouse wheel to zoom in/out
o	Click on planets to zoom in
o	Arrow keys / + / - for keyboard control


🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
•	Orbital mechanics with trigonometry
•	Real-time rendering and animation with requestAnimationFrame
•	Raycasting for hover and click detection
•	Dynamic UI generation (sliders) for each planet
•	Responsive layout and interaction
