# 3D-Solar-System

This project is a web-based 3D Solar System simulation built using Three.js. It visualizes the sun and 8 major planets in orbit, with interactive camera and control panels for adjusting camera angles, zoom, and planet orbit speeds.
🚀 Features
•	🪐 Animated orbits of Mercury through Neptune around the Sun

•	🎥 Camera controls: Distance, angle, and elevation sliders

•	🖱️ Mouse drag & scroll: Rotate and zoom the camera

•	🧭 Keyboard navigation: Arrow keys to adjust camera view

•	🖱️ Click-to-focus: Click a planet to center the camera on it

•	⏸️ Pause/Resume animation

•	🌗 Toggle between Light/Dark themes

•	🛠️ Customizable planet speeds via sliders

•	⭐ Starfield background for space realism

•	📝 Tooltips on hover to show planet names

🖥️ How to Run
1.	Save the provided code as index.html.
2.	Open it in any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
3.	Interact using:
   
o	Sliders on the right to control camera and speeds

o	Mouse drag for rotating view

o	Mouse wheel to zoom in/out


o	Click on planets to zoom in

o	Arrow keys / + / - for keyboard control


🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

•	Orbital mechanics with trigonometry

•	Real-time rendering and animation with requestAnimationFrame

•	Raycasting for hover and click detection

•	Dynamic UI generation (sliders) for each planet

•	Responsive layout and interaction
